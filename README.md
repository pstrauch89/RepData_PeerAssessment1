## Creating a files
At first, I created `PA1_template.Rmd` in RStudio.

After that, I ran `knit2html("PA1_template.Rmd")` function in separed file. It made these files:

- `PA1_template.html`,
- `PA1_template.md`,
- Concurrently, there was created `figure` directory.

## Pushing files to remote repository
At the end, I pushed my local repository on github.

## Evaluation
For my **evaluators**: Look into `PA1_template.md`.
